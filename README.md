# Challenge 9 Analysis:

## Overview of the Analysis

Analysis of the weather and the seasonal conditions on Oahu in order to determine the success or failure of an ice-cream surf shop! By comparing the weather statistics for the months of June and December. The results of the analysis are as follows:

## Results

The results of the analysis show that:

### June Temperatures:

### December Temperatures:

- Looking at the comparison of the 2 recorded temperatures for June and December, the average temp for June is about 75 degrees and the average temperature for December is 71 degrees. So, we see a difference of 4 degrees within the 2 months.

- The standard deviation for the month of June came out at 3.26 and the standard deviation for the month of December came back at 3.75. That would indicate that the dispersion of the values (temperature) was relatively similar which tells us that the average results do not contain too many outliers. Because their average temperatures were about 4 degrees apart and the standard deviation was so close, I would like to see what the highest and lowest temperatures came in at, that way we could get a better idea of just how similar these two data sets truly are.

- The highest temperature in June was 85 degrees and the highest in December was 83 degrees. In terms of weather and temperature conditions, that would not deter me away from wanting to open a shop. That tells me that the average temperatures on a daily basis are so similar. The lowest temperatures were 64 degrees (June) and 56 (December). Looking at the minimum temperate, I can already tell where the varying average and standard deviation originate from. 

## Summary

Weather can only be so predictable and that is why the analyzing the data for peak summer temps and for end of year (typically the coldest time of year) is a great indicator as to what you can expect from the weather.

In summation, I really like the approach to this study. Sure, the later months in the year might prove to be a deterrent in terms of opening a surf and ice cream business, but the data does not lie. Given that December is technically winter, the average weather conditions prove to be acceptable conditions for this business. If the investors or owners were still not convinced, I would use the following approcach as additional resources to better understand the weather conditions.

#### Rainfall: 
- Temperature can only tell us part of the story. It could be 75 degrees out in Oahu, but it could be pouring rain. I would like to get an analysis rainfall on a daily basis. 

#### Weather conditions based on the time of day: 
- More specifically midday when surfers are out, it is warm, and people are more inclined to eat ice cream. Pinpoint the temperatures to hours that people will typically be in the water/out.
